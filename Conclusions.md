## Conclusions
- By using basic artificial intelligence models, a prediction of the PM 2.5 level can be obtained with a squared error of 0.48 and 0.24 units using temperature and atmospheric pressure as independent variables respectively. This error represents an approximate difference of 5.48 µg/m2 in each temperature prediction and 6.62 µg/m2 in the prediction based on atmospheric pressure.
- There is a correlation of 0.70 and 0.51 units between the independent variables: atmospheric pressure and temperature with the objective variable, PM 2.5. This correlation is useful to determine the degree of influence of these variables on the level of air pollution with causal analysis.
- Through the application of a data pipeline, an organization and adequate direction for the investigation can be obtained, in addition, with the use of cleaning as part of the pre-processing, the predictability capacity of the development of the data analysis and proposed model and the proposed model were increased. development of data analysis and model.
- The use of programming environments such as Python and Orange 3 streamlines the implementation of mathematical equations, statistical methods and artificial intelligence models, contributing to the development of scientific research and its practical implementation.
