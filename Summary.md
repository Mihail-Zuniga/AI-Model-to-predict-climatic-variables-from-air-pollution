## Summary
The purpose of this research is to develop a simple linear regression model between climatic variables: Temperature, Relative Humidity, Atmospheric Pressure, with PM 2.5 concentration levels through the application of basic artificial intelligence models with machine learning, supervised learning and data processing from programming environments. For its realization, a database that provides climatic values of the city of Shanghai in China was used. The development was based on a structured pipeline so that variables are identified, data cleaning and preprocessing occurs, correlation and causality analysis, and finally the predictive model is created so as to determine the extent to which the application of models Basic artificial intelligence can accurately predict climate variables, in addition the results have been corroborated by studies carried out to expedite the creation of models that predict the extent to which climate change is generated from particulate matter.
